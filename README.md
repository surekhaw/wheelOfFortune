# Rock, Paper, Scissors

At The Last Mile, our Web Development Fundamentals ("WDF") students learn intermediate javascript skills. One of the required assignments by which they demonstrate their mastery of these skills is by creating a Wheel of Fortune quiz.  Students must use an object constructor to create a bank of quiz questions, and then build a quiz that displays each question one at a time at random.  The user has 10 seconds to answer each question, and some questions can have more than one correct answer.

This project is an exemplar created for The Last Mile WDF students to review after they submit their assignment so they can see a possible solution for the assignment and compare their code for ideas and improvements.  Because the purpose of the assignment is to practice javascript skills, there is minimal HTML and CSS.  

This project was created for The Last Mile while employed as a Web Development Education Apprentice and is herein included with permission of The Last Mile.  

Instructions:
Click on the "Let's Play" button to start the quiz.  Mark the answer to the question and click submit within the time allotted.  A display wiill then appear advising the user if their answer was correct or incorrect, or if they ran out of time to answer the question.  A running tally of correct and incorrect responses is also displayed.  Click on the "Next" button the move on to the next question.  After all questions have been answered, a message advising the user that the quiz has been completed appears with the total tally of correct and incorrect questions.  Click on the "Play Again" button to start the quiz over.
